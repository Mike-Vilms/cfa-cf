## Corporate Governance and ESG: An Introduction

## Capital Budgeting
- Capital budgeting is the process that companies use for decision making on capital 
projects—those projects with a life of a year or more
- The typical steps in the capital budgeting process 
are as follows:
  - Generating Ideas
  - Analyzing Individual Proposals
  - Planning the Capital Budget
  - Monitoring and Post-auditing
- Like everything else, capital budgeting is a cost–benefit exercise
- Fortunately, capital budgeting relies on just a few basic principles. Capital budgeting usually uses the following assumptions:
  - Decisions are based on cash flows. The decisions are not based on accounting concepts, such as net income
  - Intangible costs and benefits are often ignored because, if they are real, they should result in cash flows at some other time
  - Cash flows are based on opportunity costs. What are the incremental cash flows that occur with an investment compared to what they would have been without the investment?
  - Cash flows are analyzed on an after-tax basis. Taxes must be fully reflected in all capital budgeting decisions
  - Capital budgeting cash flows are not accounting net income
#### ```Concepts that are used for evaluation of capital investments```
- Net Present Value
- Internal Rate of Return
- Payback Period
