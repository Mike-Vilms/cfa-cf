## Corporate Governance and ESG: An Introduction

## Capital Budgeting
- Capital budgeting is the process that companies use for decision making on capital 
projects—those projects with a life of a year or more
- The typical steps in the capital budgeting process 
are as follows:
  - Generating Ideas
  - Analyzing Individual Proposals
  - Planning the Capital Budget
  - Monitoring and Post-auditing
- Like everything else, capital budgeting is a cost–benefit exercise
- Fortunately, capital budgeting relies on just a few basic principles. Capital budgeting usually uses the following assumptions:
  - Decisions are based on cash flows. The decisions are not based on accounting concepts, such as net income
  - Intangible costs and benefits are often ignored because, if they are real, they should result in cash flows at some other time
  - Cash flows are based on opportunity costs. What are the incremental cash flows that occur with an investment compared to what they would have been without the investment?
  - Cash flows are analyzed on an after-tax basis. Taxes must be fully reflected in all capital budgeting decisions
  - Capital budgeting cash flows are not accounting net income


#### ```Concepts that are used for evaluation of capital investments```
- **[Net Present Value](https://github.com/Mike-Vilms/cfa-i-qm/blob/main/Net-Present-Value.md)**
- **[Internal Rate of Return](https://github.com/Mike-Vilms/cfa-i-qm/blob/main/Internal-Rate-of-Return.md)**
- **Discounted payback period** - is the number of years it takes for the cumulative discounted cash flows from a project to equal the original investment
- **Average Accounting Rate of Return** = {Average net income} / {Average Book Value}; (Based on accounting numbers and not based on cash flows, does not account for the time value of money)
- **Profitability Index == Benefit–cost Ratio** - {PV of future cash flows} / {Initial investment}
- **[NPV Profile](https://github.com/Mike-Vilms/cfa-i-cf/blob/main/NPV-Profile.md)**
- **```Ranking Conflicts between NPV and IRR```**:
  - In the case of two mutually exclusive projects, the two criteria will sometimes disagree. For example, Project A might have a larger NPV than Project B, but Project B has a higher IRR than Project A. In this case, should you invest in Project A or in Project B?
  - Whenever the NPV and IRR rank two mutually exclusive projects differently, as they do in the example, **you should choose the project based on the NPV**:
